## Create a page for all the Hogwarts houses

Make a page with four sections: one for each house. When page loads, only one section should be visible. (Your favorite house.) Clicking other house names in the nav should hide the visible house and show the chosen one.

### Requirements

* Start by wireframing/sketching.
* Bootstrap optional.

### Nav

* Make a spritemap of Hogwarts houses using Sass. (Originals included in repo.)
* Use the spritemap for the four nav items, which should just be images, no text.
 
## jQuery

* Use jQuery to capture the clicks on the nav. 
* Clicking a nav item should change the class on the body so that it only shows the content from the house that's been clicked.
* It should also change the background color.

### Each section should have:

* Some text. Feel free to use the [Harry Potter Wikia](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses).
* 1 or more SVGs from [thenounproject.com](thenounproject.com).
* 1-3 icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Just follow the insructions.
* A video, using [responsive tools](http://css-tricks.com/rundown-of-handling-flexible-media/)

### Use media queries to

* Make the SVG get bigger/smaller when window gets bigger/smaller.
